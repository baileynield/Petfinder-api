# Petfinder-api
A fully fuctional backend that will make use of these technologies: FastAPI, Pydantic, Postgres, SqlAlchemy, SQLite, and Alembic. This will be able to take a petfinder-api and use that to display information of animals in certain shelters. There will be a favorites page that will allow you to easily locate those specific animals in specific shelters that you can visit.
